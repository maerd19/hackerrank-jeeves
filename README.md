# Hackerrank Jeeves Challenge

To whom it may concern:

I tried to complete the challenge at this url: https://click.pstmrk.it/2sm/www.hackerrank.com%2Ftests%2F6ppahrsamk1%2Flogin%3Fb%3DeyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFsZWphbmRyb2hlcm5hbmdAZ21haWwuY29tIiwicGFzc3dvcmQiOiI3YzMwYzEyYSIsImhpZGUiOnRydWUsImFjY29tbW9kYXRpb25zIjpudWxsfQ%3D%3D/E_Vz2i0N/EDcI/j_2-63JMgN/aHJ3LXRlc3QtaW52aXRl
but was unable to complete it in time due an issue that I had.

I took the liberty of completing the challenge in this repo with the instructions I remembered and code that I had already placed in the hackerrank environment.

Best Regards
